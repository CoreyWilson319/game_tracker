# game_tracker


### User Story:
I don’t finish games, So I want users to be able to see a list of games or search them and add them to games they’re playing. I want users to be able to take down notes and jot down what they were doing when they last played. Way to track if user is finished with game, in the middle of the game, or dissatisfied and not planning on playing the game anymore.

### Planned Technologies
Django, Postgresql, Python

### Functionality
User can have many games, Users can have 1 set of notes per game and should only be shown the latest, Only Users and Friends of that user can see their notes. All users can see what games a user is playing
