# game_tracker


### User Story:
I don’t finish games, So I want users to be able to see a list of games or search them and add them to games they’re playing. I want users to be able to take down notes and jot down what they were doing when they last played. Way to track if user is finished with game, in the middle of the game, or dissatisfied and not planning on playing the game anymore.

### Technologies Used
Django, Postgresql, Python

### Functionality
Users can sign up to add games to a collection of games that all users can add to what they are playing, as well as removing that game from that collection. Users can have many games and many notes for a game. This project uses Django, Postgresql and Python. Users can see all of there notes that they have made for every game and they can also delete their the notes that they have left.
